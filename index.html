                        Born from a promise to its creator, the Kootenai Tribe of Idaho now exists as a sovereign tribal government. On September 20th, 1974, the 67 remaining Kootenais declared a peaceful war on the United States of America. From the persistence of those emboldened forerunners, the Kootenais were deeded 12.5 acres of land, ushering a new age for the people.

                        Today, this Northern Idaho tribe carries over 150 members, working to further the development of the areas natural environments, and protect the land gifted to them by their Creator.

                        “I have created you Kootenai People to look after this beautiful land, to honor and guard and celebrate my Creation here, in this place. As long as you do that, this land will meet all our needs.” These are the words said to the first Kootenai People, by the Creator. From these words, the "Creator's Covenant" was established, guiding the Kootenai people through history and it's hardships.

                        <p>
                            In 1855, the United States sent representatives to make a treaty with all tribes in the Northwest. Tribal representatives met at Hellgate in Montana but were told that the government wanted to take the aboriginal territory and put the tribe on a reservation. No Kootenai ever signed the treaty.
